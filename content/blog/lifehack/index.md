## My method to the madness, is madness in the method

In a world where the intricacies and details of services are vast ever-present, we as both consumers and creators must navigate the shifting ground with grace.

This process of discovery is non-linear.  The absurdity of trying to learn everything step by step is deftly presented as Alice walks "Through the Looking Glass" in Lewis Carroll's illuminating illustration her world, “it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place.”.

So what is a person to do in this sort of world? The answer may be beyond the scope of this article, but I have found some useful methods from which I perceive to be helpful.As both consumer and creator, I want to explore my surroundings enough to be familar, but never stuck.

Heuristics:

* Do away with structured learning (learn everything that interests you)
* Be lazy, find the shortcuts (efficient) (design, compression, a la carte third-party apis) (look for the service that had solved the problem better than you, or look for the historical case that solved the problem in a previous context) (this hack works in reverse and is why i learn history, so that when it comes to solving a problem I have both trained my perception as well as have a vast context)  Anecdotes, lines of shakespeare, idiomatic phrases, all convey a large amount of infomration in a small package (compression)  Frameworks, conventions, design patterns, namespacing/encapsulation, abstraction all work on the same principle of reducing cognitive load (find the shortcuts)
* Be disciplined and work hard in the area which you want to gain (consistency is accuracy) Pareto distribution -  It will actually be more rewarding and less struggle and more enjoyable if you build in areas that you  choose to focus (health, money, social).  Consistency is key.  The habit is a form of laziness, because soon you won't be working as hard and accomplishing more and more.  Sometime is it accomplishing things in less steps, and sometimes is making those steps routine so they take less toll on your physical and mental resources
* Enjoy life, take breaks, walk away, take tangents, refresh, meditate, long walks, breath, pomodoro method

Through errors comes discovery - explore something “just barely related” and enjoy the “procrastination”. Comes in handy

Lessons from a programming
A la cart services- someone has probably created the service or api for you - need to plug into it, you will probably have THE best service available for that functionality
