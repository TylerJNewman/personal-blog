If ever find yourself working on something way too long.  Perhaps you have tried something over and over again. Maybe you are building an ikea dresser drawer and cannot, for the life of you, figure out what is going wrong...

##Pro tip:
Find that person who is doing something unrelated and ask them for a moment of their time to explain the issue.  Often times, the new mode of thinking will trigger an insight into the problem.  Also, by breaking down your steps to explain the issue to someone you will most likely look closer at something you were previously glossing over.

In programming world, this hack also works really well when creating issues on a github repository.  You get the added benefit of learning from others as well as providing a place for fellow developers to find an answer to the same problem.  

So go ahead and break down your steps and put an issue on github, or get perhaps find a community on a slack channel or spectrum.chat

Also, long walks always seem to be a good idea...
