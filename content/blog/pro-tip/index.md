If ever find yourself working on something way too long. Perhaps you have tried
something over and over again. Maybe you are building an ikea dresser drawer and
cannot, for the life of you, figure out what is going wrong...

## A Method For Breaking The Loop:

Find that person who is doing something unrelated and ask them for a moment of
their time and if they are willing to allow you to explain your problem. Often
times, as you are breaking down the problem in order to communicate, this
process will trigger an insight. By breaking down your thoughts into steps and
giving context to your issue, you are likely look closer at something you were
previously glossing over.

For developing, this hack also works really well when creating issues on a
github repository. You are forced to give context to your issue as well as break
down the steps to recreate it. By creating a discussion on a public forum, you
get the added benefit of learning from others as well as providing a place for
fellow developers to find an answer to the same problem.

When a friend, colleague, or community is not suitable for your timeframe or
situation, long walks and breaks are always an option...
